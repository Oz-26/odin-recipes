        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> If you love eating avocados and tortilla chips, then this chunky guacamole recipe will serve as a great appetizer or snack. This fresh and healthy dip can easily have you go through an entire bag of tortilla chips; carb watchers beware. You can adjust the chunkiness to your preference by varying the amounts of chopped ingredients.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium size avocados</li>
            <li>2 roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 jalapeño pepper</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup finely diced red onion</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 small lime</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice each avocado in half, remove the pit, and use a spoon to scoop out the avocado from the peel.</li>
                <li>Add avocado to a medium bowl and fork mash until desired consistency is reached (more mashing will make it smoother).</li>
                <li>Next dice tomatoes and finely dice red onion. For the jalapeño, remove the stem and slice in half. For a spicier guacamole, leave some of the seeds intact. For mild, use a spoon to scoop out the insides of each half of the pepper. Dice or finely mince the pepper depending on desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Add diced ingredients, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup chopped fresh cilantro, and juice of one lime to the bowl along with seasoning.</li>
                <li>Mix and have a taste test using a tortilla chip. Add any additional salt, spices, and cilantro to your liking. It's that easy. Enjoy!</li>
